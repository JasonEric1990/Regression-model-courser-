## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<h2>Exploratory</h2>

Because in liner regression there is a lot of assumption that depend on Gaussian distribution.So at the first ,we need to see there is highly skewed or not
```{r}
data("mtcars")
library(ggplot2)
mtcars$am=as.factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$am=ifelse(mtcars$am==1,"manual","automatic")
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg,fill=am))+geom_density(bw=2)+facet_grid(am~.)+ggtitle("Distribution of am in mtcars data")
```



It seems that the variate that we are most interested in is ok.
Next:we check the other variates.
```{r}
pairs(mtcars[,-9], panel = panel.smooth, main = "variates scatter plot in car", col = 3)
```

<h2>Make the models</h2>
first see the just one variate that we are interested.
```{r}
lm.fit.just.one<-lm(mpg~factor(am),data=mtcars)
summary(lm.fit.just.one)
```
Then use the nested models(put in the variable randomly) and other way to make model and compare it(some steps it's for convenient to save time).
```{r}
lm.1<-lm(mpg~factor(am)+factor(cyl)+wt,data=mtcars)
lm.2<-lm(mpg~factor(am)+factor(cyl)+disp+hp+drat+wt+qsec,data=mtcars)
lm.multi<-lm(mpg~factor(cyl)+disp+hp+drat+wt+qsec+factor(vs)+factor(am)+factor(gear)+factor(carb),data=mtcars)
best_model <- step(lm.multi, direction = "both")
anova(lm.fit.just.one,lm.1,lm.2,best_model)
```
It seems  the model lm.1 is most significant ,and that it means when we add wt changes most!!But after we check Rss is lm.2 best.
Check lm.2 solely.
```{r}
summary(lm.2)
```
The model is significant,and it also verify that the most significant variate is wt.
<h3>Residual plot</h3>
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)); plot(lm.2)
```
We can see the model is good.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>:
Then we chek most significant variate and the things that we are interesting.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg,y=wt,color=am))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Scatter of wt & mpg in mtcars data by am")
```


It seems that can answer the question which we are interested in.
